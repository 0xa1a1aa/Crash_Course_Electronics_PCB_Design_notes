# Parallel capacitors

The capacitance of parallel capacitors are simply added together:

Capacitors in series are mostly inserted to filter out different frequencies, not for the sum of their capacitances.
# Series capacitors

The total inverse capacitance of series capacitors is their inverse capacitance added together:
