Voltage = Current * Resistance
V = I * R

>[!Note]
>\[...] power in an AC circuit is calculated differently then power in a DC circuit. The definition of power is always the same, but Equation 1.12 assumes that the voltage and current are constant and only gives the **instantaneous power**.

AC - Voltage and current in phase (top) and Voltage and current out of phase (bottom)
