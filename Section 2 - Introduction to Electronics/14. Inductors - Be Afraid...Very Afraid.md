Wikipedia:
>An inductor, also called a coil, choke, or reactor, is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it.

Operation (Design_Game_Console book):
>The basic inductor is nothing more than a coil of wire (usually insulated) with a number of coils and a coil radius. The operation is as follows; as a current is applied to the inductor coil a magnetic field sets up. This magnetic field stores energy and when the current is removed from the inductor the field will collapse and generate a voltage and hence current in the opposite direction that the initial current set the magnetic field up with.

Usage (Design_Game_Console book):
> Inductors are used in electronics similarly as capacitors are in filtering circuits.
