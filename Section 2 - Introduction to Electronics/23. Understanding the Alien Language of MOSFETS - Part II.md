# N-channel enhancement mode MOSFET circuit

"Low-side switching": the MOSFET is closer to the GND (low-side) compared to the load.

In green we calculated the current that will flow through the pull-down resistor (R<sub>off</sub>) when the switch is pressed.

# P-channel enhancement mode MOSFET circuit

"High-side switching": the MOSFET is closer to the Vcc (high-side) compared to the load.

The MOSFET will be turned on when the gate voltage is pulled low (on button press). The pull-up resistor makes sure that the gate voltage is pulled high and the MOSFET is off.
The current Id flows from source -> drain.
