How it works (book):
>Referring to Figure 1.37 transformers are nothing more than coupled inductors. The key to their operation is a property called mutual inductance. Meaning, that as long as the two coils of the primary and secondary are wound together in close proximity (or around a ferromagnetic core like iron) then the magnetic field created in the primary coil will create a magnetic field in the secondary coil, and hence a voltage/current will be induced. This voltage is proportional the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary N2 to the primary N1 along with the input voltage.
