P-Type (left) and N-Type (right) Material atomically put/melted together.
The interface region is called the **Depletion Region**, where after a short time the equilibrium between the holes and electrons is found.

When enough voltage (usually ~ 0.7 V) is applied to the P and N Region, the potential barrier becomes smaller, and finally current will through from the P to the N region.

On the other hand, if the P-N junction is reverse biased, the potential barrier becomes even larger and no current flows.

>Current will flow if the voltage forward biases the P-N junction and no current will flow if the voltage reverse biases the P-N junction.

>Bias simply means a voltage applied to a device, usually a semiconductor device.

# Diode

With this attributes a Diode (a simple P-N junction) can be made:

In a diode current can only flow in one direction (anode -> cathode).
