In this circuit, when the switch is not pressed, the base of the transistor has no voltage and thus the transistor does not pass current from the collector to the emitter, and the LED stays on.
But when the button is pressed the transistor is switched on, and the current is sinked to ground, pulling it away from the LED, thus turning it off.

Switch is not pressed => transistor is off

(Resistor collector = 220 Ohm, Resistor Base = 3.3k Ohm)

Switch is pressed => transistor is on

In this example a motor is installed in the circuit at the collector. So when the button is pressed, the base current switches the transistor on, allowing current to flow from the collector to the emitter, and the motor is turned on.

(Resistor collector = 100 Ohm)

>[!Note] Inductive kickback
>Since the motor is an inductive load, when the motor is turned off, the magnetic field of the motor will create an electric current, that flows back into the circuit (Inductive kickback current).
>In order to protect the circuit from the inductive kickback current a diode is installed into the circuit (see below).
