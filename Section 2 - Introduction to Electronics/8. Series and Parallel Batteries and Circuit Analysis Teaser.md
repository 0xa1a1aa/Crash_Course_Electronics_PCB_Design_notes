# Serial

If batteries are put in series their **voltages are added together**.
In the first example above four 1.5V batteries are put in series, which in total results to 4 * 1.5 = 6V

Batteries have a small internal resistance, as depicted in the image below with R1, R2, R3.
Therefore, some small amount of voltage is dropped over this internal resistance.

>[!Info]
>The cause of the internal resistance of the cell is that **the electrode and electrolytes are not perfectly conductive**.

# Parallel

When batteries are put in parallel **the total voltage remains the same, but each batterie can source current**. As a result the total amount of current that can be supplied to the circuit is 4 times higher than with a single battery. Or the lifetime of each batterie is increased by 4 times.
