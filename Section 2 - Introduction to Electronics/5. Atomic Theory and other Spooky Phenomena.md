# Bohr model

>[!Note]
>This model has been revised, but is still good for the understanding of electricity in the kontext of this course.

>In atomic physics, the Bohr model or Rutherfordâ€“Bohr model of the atom, presented by Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford in 1913, consists of a small, dense nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons.

A basic model of the atom:

Carbon (poor conductor) is used in resistor construction.

The outer shell of a atom is called **Valence**.
**Conductors** have loose bound electrons in the outer shell, while **Resistors** have strong bound electrons in the outer shell.

**Current** is the movement of the electrons in the outer shell of atoms, by a "force" called **Voltage**.

>[!Note] Conventional and non conventional current
>The difference between conventional and non conventional current is that, conventional current is a direction of flow of holes and non conventional current is a direction of flow of negatively charge electrons (in opposite direction) under the influence of electric field.
