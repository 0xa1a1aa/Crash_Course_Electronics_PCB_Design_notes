# Kirchhoff’s current law

>[!Info] Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL)
>Kirchhoff’s current law or “KCL” as it’s commonly referred to states that the sum of the currents at any node in an electrical network is zero. In other words, you can never create, nor destroy current, only move it. If 1A of current enters a node then 1A of current must exit that node. And let’s be very specific with what we mean by a node. A node is a point in a circuit where two or more electrical components are connected.

>[!Note]
>\[...] currents leaving a node to be negative, currents entering a node to be positive.

Example:

KCL in node A:
i<sub>1</sub> enters the node (positive)
i<sub>2</sub>, i<sub>3</sub>, i<sub>4</sub> leave the node (negative)
=> KCL A: +i<sub>1</sub> - i<sub>2</sub> - i<sub>3</sub> - i<sub>4</sub> = 0
=> i<sub>1</sub> = i<sub>2</sub> + i<sub>3</sub> + i<sub>4</sub>
