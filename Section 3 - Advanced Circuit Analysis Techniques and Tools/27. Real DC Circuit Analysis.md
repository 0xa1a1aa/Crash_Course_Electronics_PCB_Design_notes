**Specification:**
Given 2 batteries with 9V and 1.5V and a current I<sub>R<sub>1</sub></sub> = 25mA we want to know what resistor R<sub>1</sub> is needed.
**Analysis:**
With Ohm's law we calculate that we need a 420Ohm resistor. Also the power dissipated by the resistor is 0.25Watts. So in order to be on the safe side, we would take a 1/2 Watt resistor.
