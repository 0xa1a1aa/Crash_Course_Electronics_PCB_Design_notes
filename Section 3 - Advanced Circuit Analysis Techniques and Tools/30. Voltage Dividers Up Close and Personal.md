>[!Note]
>The basis is you must consider the load of the circuit. The whole point of using a voltage divider is to use this voltage to drive another part of the circuit maybe another stage. If the other part of the circuit you are driving has really high input resistance then it will pull very little current from your circuit and thus will not disturb it, but if the stage you are driving has very little resistance or impedance then it will disturb your circuit a great deal and actually change the voltage by changing the current.
